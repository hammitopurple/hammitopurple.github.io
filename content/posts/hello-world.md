summary = 'Writing is hard, but shitposting is harder'
+++

Sometimes I just have things that I want to write but I don't have a place to write them,
and I'm not comfortable tagging these intrusive thoughts under my IRL name, 
so I have to pen them down under a pseudonym on a corner of the internet.

I thought writing shitposts on the internet would be an easy thing to do but I have already
edited the previous sentence like 6 times so I'm not sure if this would be as cartharthic
an activity as I thought.

In any case I've finally set up a Hugo blog and chosen a nice spiffy theme, and
sunk costs dictate that I at least keep this up for a while.

Inspiration comes to me when I'm either angry or drunk so I suspect my future posts will
either be angry rants at javascript developers or drunk rants at javascript developers.

And I don't even write javascript for `$dayjob`. 

(But I write java so I guess that makes me a javascript developer too)
