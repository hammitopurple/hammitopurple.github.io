After four months of painstaking work, I have finally completed the entirety of
[The Rust Programming Language](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/title-page.html), 
including all of the quizzes in this version of the book. This is the first time
I've ever read a programming textbook from cover to cover, and I must say I was
quite impressed by myself.

Rust is quite an interesting language and kinda messes with your brain for a bit 
because it has such unique take on memory management. I've only been using
high-level languages such as Go and Java, so there was never a need to manage 
memory by yourself.

Go and Java both rely on a garbage collector (GC) to free up memory during runtime,
but Rust doesn't have such a feature. Instead, it relies on this novel idea of 
_ownership_, which frankly is the hardest concept I've had to grapple with while
learning Rust.

This post is not going to be a deep dive or discussion of any features in Rust,
it's purely meant to celebrate my own accomplishments. My motivations for learning
Rust was to apply it in my `$dayjob`, and to also prove something to the me from a 
decade ago who gave up on Chapter 2 of The Rust Programming Language.
