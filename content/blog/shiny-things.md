Reminder to self to focus on my current job and stop envy-scrolling on LinkedIn.
While there are some unpleasant things about `$dayjob`, nothing can beat the
financial security it offers, and honestly I do get to work with and on things
I've always wanted to do in the past.

The grass always seems greener on the other side, until you touch it.

Speaking of other shiny things, I'm looking at exploring machine learning. Looking
to complete the [Practical Deep Learning](https://course.fast.ai/) course. ML
seems rather out of fashion in the current LLM hype cycle, but I would rather
take some time to appreciate the fundamentals than jump on the latest bandwagon
that I do not understand.
