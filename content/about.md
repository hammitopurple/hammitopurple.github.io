I work as a Software Engineer in a big tech company as my `$dayjob`. I'm now
working on internal security platforms and services, which is something I'm
quite interested and invested in.

I previously worked in offensive security as a Penetration Tester for 4 years
and only recently made a career switch to the SWE industry. Currently, I have slightly
less than 2 years of experience, which I understand puts me in a rather precarious
position in today's job market.
