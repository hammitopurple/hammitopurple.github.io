title = 'About'

I work as a software engineer in a big tech company as my `$dayjob`. Currently working on internal security platforms and services.

I'm not a fresh graduate but am pretty new to the SWE industry, having only slightly less than 2 years
of experience, which puts me in a vulnerable position in today's job market.

I'm looking out for professional mentors, so if you would be so kind, do leave uh, a pull request
in this code repo, I guess?
