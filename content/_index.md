# `whoami`

I work as a Software Engineer in a big tech company as my `$dayjob`. Currently
working on internal security platforms and services, which can be a rather
challenging domain.

In my past life I worked in offensive security as a pentester, but made the 
switch because it was much more fun to build software than to poke holes in them.
